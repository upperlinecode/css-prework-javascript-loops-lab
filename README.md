# Beatles Loops

Create three functions that pay homage to Fab Four. These functions will have one of each type of loops: for, do and do/while.

Make sure you run the tests by opening `SpecRunner.html` in your browser.

## Lennon Facts in a While Loop

Your first function will use a while loop to add exaggerated punctuation to  odd facts about the Beatles' guitarist.

```js
facts = ["He was the last Beatle to learn to drive", "He was never a vegetarian", "He was a choir boy and boy scout", "He hated the sound of his own voice"];
```
* **Name**: johnLennonFacts
* **Input**:  one parameter, the array of original facts
* **Code Block**:
 1. Create a variable, excitingFacts that stores an empty array.
 2. Use a while loop to add `"!!!"` to the end of every fact
 3. Use the push array method to add the new exciting fact to excitingFacts
* **Output**: return the modified sentences, excitingFacts

## The Fab Four in a For Loop
Create a function that uses a for loop to explain the role of each Brit by using a list of their names and their instruments.

```js
musicians = ["John Lennon", "Paul McCartney", "George Harrison", "Ringo Starr"];
instruments = ["Guitar", "Bass Guitar", "Lead Guitar", "Drums"];
```

* **Name**: theBeatlesPlay,
* **Input**: two parameters- an array of musicians and an array of instruments.
* **Code Block**:
 1. Create an empty array stored in a variable
 2. Use a for loop which loops over the array of musicians.
 3. Create a string using the first index of the musicians array and the first index of the instruments array to produce: `"John Lennon plays guitar"`. You can index the musicians array and the instruments array at the same time [Rosetta Code Reference](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Loop_over_multiple_arrays_simultaneously#Imperative).
 4. Add each string to the empty array
* **Output**: The function should return the array of new strings.

## Devotion in a Do/While Loop
Your last function will use a do/while loop to express adoration with the Beatles. This function will make sure everyone is aware of your feelings at least once and up to 10 times. The function should accept a parameter indicating the number of times the declaration of love should be printed.

* **Name**: iLovetheBeatles
* **Input**: one parameter, a number
* **Code Block**:
 1. Create a variable that stores an empty array.
 2. Implement a do/while loop inside the function that adds `"I love the Beatles!"` to the empty array.
 3. Then the loop should increment the number passed in as a parameter.
 4. The condition of the loop should check to see that the parameter number is less than `10`.
* **Output**: The function should return the array with the strings `"I love the Beatles!"`.
